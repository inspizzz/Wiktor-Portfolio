        <p> This is my collection of my solutions to the <a href="https://adventofcode.com/">2023 Advent of Code</a> challenges, I'll be uploading my solutions to these challenges to here and hopefully update this regularly. This is also a side quest for me to learn some vim and explore implementation in a variety of programming languages. This is going to be fun.</p>
